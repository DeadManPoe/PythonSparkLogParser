# PythonSparkLogParser
A python script that operates a simple parse into csv files of a Spark log.
To use the parser:

1. Type ```python parser.py [PATH_TO_JSON_FILE_TO_PARSE] [ID_TO_BE_PUT_INTO_CSV_FILENAMES]```
2. You will find the csv files resulting from the parsing process under the ```output``` folder

Note that the ```parser.py``` contains default parsing field that can be changed inside
the code of the python file.
Note that Python 2.7 is required.
